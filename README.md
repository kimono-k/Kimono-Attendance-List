# Kimono-Attendance-List
 An attendence list based on the JSON data

# You can modify someone's attendence in the classmates.json file, just try it.
1) Download the project files.
2) Open index.html in your favourite browser, just make sure that you run this on a server like localhost.
3) Open classmates.json and set the atSchool to false for example.
4) See how the CSS changes based on the true and false value :)
