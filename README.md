# Kimono-Attendance-List
An attendence list based on the JSON data

You can modify someone's attendence in the classmates.json file, just try it :)
1) Download the project files.
2) Open index.html in your favourite browser, just make sure that you run this on a server like localhost.
3) Open classmates.json and set the atSchool to false for example.
4) See how the CSS changes based on the true and false value!

For example, let's say Dani is in class, so let's set his value to true!

# If you are a lazy bum 
Or just take a look at my GitHub page however, without a server set up there is no magic!
